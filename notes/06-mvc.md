# MVC

MVC DAY ONE (Week 3 Day 1)

Design pattern:

bcw create 

//capital C in Character to signify class model
//class creates a blueprint for a data object

class Character {

    name

    role

    health

    maxHealth

    constructor(newName, newRole, newHealth) {
        this.name = newName
        this.role = newRole
    }
}


Character then hit Tab

what order do I build in

1. Make the Model and properties 
2. create data using that model in the appstate
3. make the controller, and have the controller draw the data to the page (either with html templates or just string con-cat) 
4. add interactions to page elements
5. the rest of it.....
