# JavaScript

Day One JS Code (week2 day1)


use <script src "app.js"> <script> 

load scripts at the end of body because they take the longest to load


name variables as exact as possible

let greeting = 'Hello'

` backticks can break lines

Day 2 JS Code (week 2 day2)

Arrays

forEach() 

=> is lambda or lambda function

anonymous function

animals.forEach(() => {
    console.log 
}
)

predicate function is a callback that has to return something

math.floor = round down
math.ceiling = round up

Day 3 JS Code (week 2 day 3)

Sammy's Sandwich

SOLID principle

[S]ingle Responsibility - build one function to do one job really well

new Array use

arrayName.find()

            //nameOfArray find (banana word) the one sandwich which 'name' is 'caprese'          
let caprese = sandwiches.find(sandwich => sandwich.name == 'caprese') // look for all the sandwiches 

//increases the quantity of caprese in the array
caprese.quantity ++

console.log ('buying caprese', caprese)

innerHTML rewrites the HTML like the whole divs 

innerText rewrites whats in between the divs

ctrl+d on highlighted same words allows you to manipulate all the words selected

drawCart replaces the draw to the DOM that's commented out

cartElem is getDocumentById

`` ${} are needed to inject HTML in javascript


let template = '' //is a placeholder for what's being injected into the DOM  needs to be outside of the function 

anonymous function
array.forEach(banana word)
sandwiches.forEach(sandwich =>){
    if(sandwich.quantity > 0){

}
