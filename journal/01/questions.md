# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use Git to push our code to source control.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > In the terminal the 'mkdir' is used to create a new directory or folder.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element or elements. Some most common ones I would use would be :hover
    :autofill
    :active

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is used to determine which rule should be applied when multiple rules are targeting both the same element and property on that element but assigning different values.  I would use specificity to my benefit to help understand why I am getting a certain result. If I am expecting my background to be green but it is red I can find which rule is overruling my result and can troubleshoot.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > If you overused the '!important' feature you can end up having issues troubleshooting your code. You won't know which line of code is applying the style. Also if everything is !important it ends up being nothing is !important.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The three components that make up a 'CSS' rule are selector, property, and value.
     h1 = selector; color = property ; rgba(255,210, 33, .75) = value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > I think a good design influences people that visit a website in a positive way. When people see a well laid out webpage they are more inclined to stay on that site and trust the owners of the site. For example if a person visited a website of a website designer and that site was not designed well, people wouldn't trust that person to build them a website. I feel the same way about other businesses. I feel that a proper website instills trust in a consumer. Some other things that a good design conveys to a person is that when they have an up to date site with current data, that person knows that business is on top of things.  When there is old data and the website is not current, it can reflect the practices of that business, meaning they won't be on top of the service they are providing.    

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > The purpose of wireframing is to design a webpage at a structural level. It is used to layout content and functionality on a page. Wireframing establishes the basic structure of the page before visual design and content are added.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes, I believe wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require because the best plans are laid out piece by piece.  Wireframing allows the concept of the webpage to develop. It demonstrates the functionality and flow of the webpage so during the coding process things will go smoother.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Flex property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit in the space available in its flex container.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > The CSS properties that affect the size of a box model include: borders, margin, padding, and the content itself.
