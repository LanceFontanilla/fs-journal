# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It is a fundamental concept in OOP that promotes code reuse and establishes relationships between classes.

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer design pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

The observer pattern is often used to implement event-driven programming.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> The strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The factory design pattern is a software design pattern that allows you to create objects without specifying their concrete class. This can be useful when you want to create objects of different types at runtime, or when you want to decouple your code from the concrete classes of the objects it creates.

06. What is test driven development?

> Red, Green and Refactor is the three phase of Test Driven Development and this the sequence that get followed while writing code. 

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> The Definition of Done (DoD) represents the organization's formal definition of quality for all Product Backlog Items (PBIs).

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> The sprint backlog is created during the planning stage of the sprint. 

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> A sprint backlog is the set of items that a cross-functional product team selects from its product backlog to work on during the upcoming sprint. Typically the team will agree on these items during its sprint planning session.
