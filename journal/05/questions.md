# Intro to Server side concerns with JavaScript
01. What do the letters of the acronym `CRUD` stand for?

  > CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.  We use CRUD when we want to Create, view, edit or remove data inside an application's database.

02. Each action that `CRUD` represents maps to an HTTP request. What HTTP request does each `CRUD` action correspond to?

  > Create maps to POST, Read maps to Get, Update maps to Put, and Delete maps to Delete.   

03. What does `ORM` stand for? Which `ORM` do we use when interacting with MongoDB

  > ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.  We use mongo as our ORM to interact with MongoDB.

04. Which two `HTTP` request types include a body?

  > The two HTTP requst types that include a body are Create and Update.

05. In a/an _______ coding model, when you call a function, it returns only when the action has finished and stops your program for the time the action takes. Likewise in a/an _______ coding model, multiple things are allowed to happen at one time. When you perform an action, your program continues to run.  Fill in the blanks.

  > In a Synchronous coding model, you call a function and it returns only when the action has finished.  In as Asynchronouse coding model multpile things are allowed to happen at one time.

06. What are the three types of data relationships? Provide an example of each.

  > The three types of data relationships are 1 to 1, 1 to many, and many to many.  A 1 to 1 relationship is where 1 person lives at 1 address and an address only has 1 person living there.  An example of a 1 to many relationship is where there is 1 X tweet has many comments but even though there are many comments it is only related to that single X tweet. A many to many example would be where one book was written by many authors but at the same time the author has written many books.

07. What is middleware?

  > Middleware is a function that is used to process an HTTP request before it is passed to the next middleware function or to the final handler.  

08. The ______ pipeline delivers information from the client while the ______ pipeline returns it. Fill in the blanks. 

  > Upstream delivers info from the client, downstream returns it. ???

09. Demonstrate the pattern that is used to include a request query with the client's `HTTP` request providing the property `tag` and the value `winter`.

  > I don't know what this means. 

10. What is a ***virtual property***?

  > A virtual property is a property whose behavior can be overridden within an inheriting class. This concept is an important part of the polymorphism portion of Object Oriented Programming.
